# WorkoutTracker

Studies indicate, people who track workout progress will reach their fitness goals quicker than those who don't track workouts.  This workout tracker allows clients to view, create, and track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in their daily workout; tracking includes workout name, type, weight, sets, reps, duration of exercise, and distance traveled for cardio exercises.
